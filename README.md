This is a Python Repository using shortest path algorithms and custom to weights to find more optimal routes that compares against Googles

Algos Used: 
1) Bellman-Ford
2) A*
3) Dijkstra's
4) Floyd-Warshall
5) A* Manhattan Distance
6) A* Euclidiean Distance

Custom Weights:
1) Speed Limit Stress- Penalized actions on using roads with a lower speed limit

2) Traffic Congestion Patterns - Depending on what time of day the route is happening on will either penalize or

3) Road Type Selection - Penalizes 
   
4) Weather Conditions - Adds time onto the route when extreme weather conditions are present


Approach: 
Use different Python libraries to represent a map as a grid. Used different algos with custom weights to see how the routes would change. 
Multiple different routes were created and valuable information on the affects of real time data.
